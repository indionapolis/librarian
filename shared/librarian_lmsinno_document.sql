The authors focus on the importance of natural language-the carrier of knowledge and intelligence-for artificial intelligence (AI) study. This book develops a framework that shows how uncertainty in AI expands and generalizes traditional AI. It describes the cloud model, its uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness, and the correlation between them. The book also centers on other physical methods for data mining, such as the data field and knowledge discovery state space. In addition, it presents an inverted pendulum example to discuss reasoning and control with uncertain knowledge as well as provides a cognitive physics model to visualize human thinking with hierarchy.

Human-robot interaction raises serious ethical questions right now that are theoretically less ambitious, but practically more important than the possibility of the creation of moral machines that would be more than machines with an ethical code. The ethical perspective addressed in this volume is therefore the one we humans have when interacting with robots. Topics include the ethical challenges of healthcare and warfare applications of robotics, as well as fundamental questions concerning the moral dimension of human-robot-interaction including epistomological, ontological and psychoanalytic issues. It deals also with the intercultural dialogue between Western and Non-Western as well as between European and US-American ethicists."--P.

The behavior of biological systems provides both the inspiration and the challenge for robotics. The goal is to build robots which can emulate the ability of living organisms to integrate perceptual inputs smoothly with motor responses, even in the presence of novel stimuli and changes in the environment. The ability of living systems to learn and to adapt provides the standard against which robotic systems are judged. In order to emulate these abilities, a number of investigators have attempted to create robot controllers which are modelled on known processes in the brain and musculo-skeletal system. Several of these models are described in this book. On the other hand, connectionist (artificial neural network) formulations are attractive for the computation of inverse kinematics and dynamics of robots, because they can be trained for this purpose without explicit programming. Some of the computational advantages and problems of this approach are also presented.

This volume is the first book to bring together prominent scholars and experts from both science and the humanities to explore these and other questions in this emerging field.Starting with an overview of the issues and relevant ethical theories, the topics flow naturally from the possibility of programming robot ethics to the ethical use of military robots in war to legal and policy questions, including liability and privacy concerns. The contributors then turn to human-robot emotional relationships, examining the ethical implications of robots as sexual partners, caregivers, and servants.

In THE AGE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY, Wall Street journalists Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey deliver the definitive answer to this question. Cybermoney is poised to launch a revolution, one that could entirely re-invent traditional financial and social structures while bringing the world''s billions of "unbanked" individuals into a new global economy. Cryptocurrency represents the promise of a financial system without a middleman, one owned by the people who use it and one safeguarded from the devastation of a 2008-type crash. But bitcoin, the most famous of the cybermonies, brings with it a reputation for instability, wild fluctuation, and illicit business; some fear it has the power to eliminate jobs and to upend the concept of a nation-state. It implies, above all, monumental and wide-reaching changeâfor better and for worse. But it is here to stay, and you ignore it at your peril.

International Cooperation. Each chapter is made up of five parts. Part I, "Introduction," begins with the analysis of money laundering risks and compliance with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and then concludes with the country''s rating based on the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) of the U.S. State Department. Part II, "Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF)" and Part III, "Criminal and Civil Forfeiture," evaluate the judicial and legislative structures of the country. Given the increasing global dimension of AML/CTF activities, these sections give special attention to how a country has created statutes, decisions, policies and the judicial enforcement procedures needed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Part IV, "Compliance," examines the most critical processes for the prevention and detection of money laundering and terrorist financing. This section reflects on the practical elements that should be in place so that financial institutions can comply with AML/CTF requirements; these are categorized into the development and implementation of internal controls, policies and procedures. Part V, "International Cooperation," reviews the compilation of international laws and treaties between countries working together to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

In my view, the content is unique in that it blends traditional teaching approaches with the use of mathematics and a mainstream Hardware Design Language (HDL) as formalisms to describe key concepts. The book keeps the âmachineâ separate from the âapplicationâ by strictly following a bottom-up approach: it starts with transistors and logic gates and only introduces assembly language programs once their execution by a processor is clearly de ned. Using a HDL, Verilog in this case, rather than static circuit diagrams is a big deviation from traditional books on computer architecture. Static circuit diagrams cannot be explored in a hands-on way like the corresponding Verilog model can. In order to understand why I consider this shift so important, one must consider how computer architecture, a subject that has been studied for more than 50 years, has evolved. In the pioneering days computers were constructed by hand. An entire computer could (just about) be described by drawing a circuit diagram. Initially, such d- grams consisted mostly of analogue components before later moving toward d- ital logic gates.

Technical Communication and the World Wide Web offers substantial and broadly applicable strategies for teaching global communication issues affecting writing for the World Wide Web. Editors Carol Lipson and Michael Day have brought together an exceptional group of experienced and well-known teacher-scholars to develop this unique volume addressing technical communication education. The chapters here focus specifically on curriculum issues and the teaching of technical writing for the World Wide Web, contributing a blend of theory and practice in proposing changes in curriculum and pedagogy. Contributors offer classroom examples that teachers at all levels of experience can adapt for their own classes. The volume provides comprehensive coverage of the technical communication curriculum, from the two-year level to the graduate level; from service courses to degree programs.

Emphasis is on defining Java constructs and their use in programming. Students are encouraged to program all the exercises at the end of each Chapter. Also students are encouraged to program their own applications to enhance their knowledge base. The idea is to program as many applications as possible using various Java constructs to improve programming skills in the Java programming language. Emphasis is placed on programming applications requirements. To enforce this paradigm Chapters are organized to maximize the learning process. Chapters on Exceptions and File Input and Output are introduced early in the text.

Oracle is arguably the most widely used relational database platform in the world. In this book, Donald Bales brings these two technologies together, and shows you how to leverage the full power of Oracle''s implementation of JDBC. You begin by learning the all-important mysteries of establishing database connections. This can be one of the most frustrating areas for programmers new to JDBC, and Donald covers it well with detailed information and examples showing how to make database connections from applications, applets, Servlets, and even from Java programs running within the database itself. Next comes thorough coverage of JDBC''s relational SQL features. You''ll learn how to issue SQL statements and get results back from the database, how to read and write data from large, streaming data types such as BLOBs, CLOBs, and BFILEs, and you''ll learn how to interface with Oracle''s other built-in programming language, PL/SQL. If you''re taking advantage of the Oracle''s relatively new ability to create object tables and column objects based on user-defined datatypes, you''ll be pleased with Don''s thorough treatment of this subject. Don shows you how to use JPublisher and JDBC to work seamlessly with Oracle database objects from within Java programs. You''ll also learn how to access nested tables and arrays using JDBC. Donald concludes the book with a discussion of transaction management, locking, concurrency, and performance--topics that every professional JDBC programmer must be familiar with.

Each chapter introduces a problem to solve, and then covers the C language constructs necessary to solve the problem.Rather than presenting a series of polished, one-step solutions to programming problems, this text seeks to lead you through the process of analyzing problems and writing programs to solve them. This text is intended to be used in a one or two semester course covering introductory programming using C.

Assuming no prior knowledge of the 8052, it takes the reader step-by-step through the architecture including discussions and explanations of concepts such as internal RAM, external RAM, Special Function Registers (SFRs), addressing modes, timers, serial I/O, and interrupts. This is followed by an in-depth section on assembly language which explains each instruction in the 8052 instruction set as well as related concepts such as assembly language syntax, expressions, assembly language directives, and how to implement 16-bit mathematical functions. The book continues with a thorough explanation of the 8052 hardware itself, reviewing the function of each pin on the microcontroller and follows this with the design and explanation of a fully functional single board computer-every section of the schematic design is explained in detail to provide the reader with a full understanding of how everything is connected, and why. The book closes with a section on hardware interfacing and software examples in which the reader will learn about the SBCMON monitor program for use on the single board computer, interfacing with a 4x4 keypad, communicating with a 16x2 LCD in direct-connect as well as memory-mapped fashion, utilizing an external serial EEPROM via the SPI protocol, and using the I2C communication standard to access an external real time clock. The book takes the reader with absolutely no knowledge of the 8052 and provides him with the information necessary to understand the architecture, design and build a functioning circuit based on the 8052, and write software to operate the 8052 in assembly language.', 'Universal-Publishers', 2005, 0, 1800, 0, 0, 'https://books.google.com/books/content?id=NHQEUzLiY1MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2', '2018-02-03', 0);
